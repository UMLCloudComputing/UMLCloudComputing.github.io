### 📓 Meeting Notes
Virtual: 5<br/>
In-Person: 18<br/>

AWS Event Driven Architecture

**What is S3** <br/>
- Bucket and object
- Versioning
- Lifecycle rules
- Storage classes
- Permissions

Quick Demo on S3
- Explain differences between paths on file storage vs object storage
- Demo versioning
- Possible to turn object storage into a file server (simple webpage)
<br/>

**Lambda** <br/>
Serverless Compute offering from AWs. <br/>
Support multiple runtimes and follows a pay as you go pricing model.
- Testing 
- Monitoring and logging
- VPC network attachment
- AWS IAM integration
- Enviornment variables
- Concurrency
    - Memory
    - Timeouts
    - Cold vs Warm Start
- Event Driven triggers

Quick Demo on Lambda
- Various ways to trigger
<br/>
**API Gateway**<br/>
Managed API service that supports multiple common connections, automatic scaling and integrates with other AWS services.
- Integrations (Lambda, VPC, etc)
- Connections
    - HTTP
    - REST
    - Websocket

Quick Demo on API Gateway

**Simple Queue Service (SQS)**<br/>
Fully managed message queuing for micorservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications
- Standard Queues vs. FIFO Queues
- Message Ordering
- Visibility Timeouts

Quick Demo on SQS

**Simple Notification Service (SNS)**<br/>
Facilitates communication between services (HTTP/s, Email, SMS, Lambda, SQS, etc)
- Pub/Sub messaging
- Topics and subscriptions
- Support delivery protocols

Quick Demo on SNS

**EventBridge**<br/>
Serverless event buss that can connect different services together
- Rules
- Targets
- Triggers
    - Crons
    - AWS Events

Quick Demo on EventBridge

Questions <br/>
- Q: SNS usecases?
    - A: Usesful for integrations with webhooks. Useful to be used within a trigger sequence that would say cause messages to be sent
