Presentation by [Mike Dame](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-dame-98600b35/)

Mike Dame:
- Works @ Google

How he got started in Open Source
- Got started @ RedHat
    - Great place to work
    - Knew about OpenShift
    - Had offer from Cisco too

Got started working on OpenShift
- Closed source work since it used a lot of billing data
- Wanted to work more open source
- Wanted to work on the product

Problem
- Had no experience working on Kubernetes

Was able to build up the experience on his own time. 
- Working with an experienced person

Reviewing issues on open source projects (Kubernetes)

Common barrier to open source
- Being scared
- Proposing a solution

As a maintainer:
- Complimented when a person offeres to contribute to work on a project

Never be afraid to open an issue

Met a bunch of new people
- Open Source, build a network, GitHub contributions show for it

Open Source networking helped land the job at Google:
- Interview
- Get matched to a team
- Knew people within Google by having been working with them in the open source world

Switching to a new company
- New form of observability, eBPF:
    - Linux kernel modules that can be hot-swapped to enable observability

Using open-source as a tool to develop your career

## Questions
How did you develop, reaching out community members?
- Entry point, CLI, `kubectl` command
- Code is available with it's commit history to understand what's been done
- Would want to change: Reach out to more people to get up to speed much faster
- Reach out to get pointers to where something connects in a large codespace
- Find an area that is easy to reproduce and test 

How does corporate interest manage within the realm of open source projects?
- Negotaiate to be best for the project
- Companies Maintain a fork that carries your feature
- OpenShift is a fork of Kubernetes
    - Maintain that all patches for Kubernetes still work with new changes of OpenShift
- It's typical for companies to have something unique asside from open source 

Important to have quality within your commits

Maintain a genuine ineterest for your work and the projects

Moving to the new company
- Vendor agnostic telemetry
    - OpenTelemetry
        - Logging is odd
        - Have to write code
- Utilize eBPF, auto instrumentation, observe your functions, make requests for statically compiled languages, started for Go.
- eBPFs has really interesting applications. Kernel development. 

eBPF
- extended Berkley Packet Filter

Recommendations to get into Go
- Kubernetes is a good project to learn Go
- Web server/Web App
    - Handling requests
    - Go Routines

Work Life Balance:
- Disconnects from coding after work
- Satisfying quantity of work
- Cool to work at big company
    - Perks
    - Smart people
- Important to work on what you care about

Working to a far distance
- Tough and requires time budgeting. 
- Not possible to do work while commuting often
- Can be done for an internship

How to find talks to conversate
- Follow on social media and communicate with people
- Networking 101

Sometimes it's possible to get too vested in a project
- Don't get too entreched at a particular company
- Keep things fresh
