### üó£Ô∏è Presentation Section

A Crash Course on Kubernetes

Sam DeLap:
- AWS Lead @ SAIC
- Working with Cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes in the Cloud
- Graduated in 2021 with Dual bachelors in Biology and Math

VM:
- Virutal Machine
- Host Hardware
- Host OS
- Hypervisor
- VM runs on top of Hypervisor
- Issues
    - Multiple Apps per VM
        - Multiple file systems, can cause overwrites
    - Each VM has it's own OS
    - Hard to avoid collisions between Apps
    - Non-graceful error/crash recovery
    - Tough to manage at scale

Containers:
- Docker Containers
- Contained applications in user space
- Host OS is same for all Containers
- Much lower overhead
- Can partition and isolate a filesystem
- Issues
    - Inter-container communications are hard and weak
    - Hard to scale again

Kubernetes:
- Container orchestration platform
- Can run mutliple containers
- Provides a core set of compnonents to manage containers
- Central way to manage containers
    - Deploy, scale, update, and monitor applications
- Original for container orchestration only, now more dynamic

Cluster
- Server
- Cloud Controller
- Controller manager
- Pods
    - Application units on Nodes
- Nodes
    - Physical or virtual machines
- Control Plane - Typically runs on seperate on one or more servers
    - API Server
        - Takes API input and output from Nodes
    - Scheduler
        - Scheduling algorithm for pods
    - Etcd
        - Key value store all of kubernetes
    - kproxy
        - Proxy for API Server and Nodes
- Highly extensible and structured, base format

Pods, Services, Deployments
- Pod lives within a node
    - Pod 2 SVC
        - Network pods in a cluster
        - A service for providing IP address and DNS names for each contianer
- Yaml files for defining objects in Kubernetes per pod


Helm
- Package manager for Kubernetes applications
- Install, update, and manage applications in Kubernetes
- Chart
    - Kubernetes objects that make up a cluster application
- Still using `yaml`
- Define configuration for entire deployment and not just individual applications

ArgoCD
- CNCF Ecosystem tour
- GitOps
    - Continuous Delivery and Deployment for Kubernetes applications
- Deploy applications for kubernetes using GitOps

Istio
- A Zero Trust application automation platform for microservices
- A control plane
    - Handle connections between pods
    - Automatic network isolation
    - Mutual TLS
    - Process level control of what can and can't connect

Prometheus
- Metrics engine for monitoring and alerting everything about your cluster
- 

Kiali
- Metrics and visualzation tool for kubernetes cluster
- Performance

KeyCloak
- OAuth for authentication and authorization
- Centralized place to define authentication and authorization policies

Ecosystems as a Service
- EaaS
- [Big Bang](https://docs-bigbang.dso.mil/latest/)
- Used for quickly get your application up and running
- Automate and maintain the secure set of base applications you need for your application

[UDS - Unicorn Delivery System](https://uds.defenseunicorns.com/structure/packages/)
- Deployements where you can't be connected to the internet
- Zarf
    - Portable Package Handler
    - All containers, charts, deployment instructions
- Custom kubernetes Resources
